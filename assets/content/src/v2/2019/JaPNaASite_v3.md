JaPNaASite revision 3.

Yes. I've re-programmed my site 3 times now. Third times a charm! Maybe this is going to be my last revision, but I doubt it. It certainly is my biggest project, currently totaling over 10k lines of code, and 300+ commits.

If the site doesn't turn out well, I can easily make this website a template for future websites, so I still get _something_ out of it.

You also should have noticed by now, that this 'description' is much longer than the other projects. This is because I also created a new format for me to write about my projects, combining [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and the power of scripts to generate several .json files.

Also, the change that I'm most excited about,

No, not that image. **THIS**. You see that?! I can have text **after** my images!! It's amazing! That reason was probably one of the biggest factors when considering this new format. That, and also being able to use markdown.

<small> and also the old format was so bad... what was I thinking?! </small>
