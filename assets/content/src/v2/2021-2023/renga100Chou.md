The english translation of the title (レンガ100丁) is "100 bricks."

This was a little simulation I made while playing around with the Godot game engine's physics.

This "project" stems from a random urge to simulate something I saw in a [video](https://youtu.be/Xu3gsN6fmhY?t=1068).

You have 100 bricks that are lined up like dominos. Topple one over and the rest also topple.

The twist here is, after all the bricks fall over, _another_ domino effect starts from the end. (It's easier if you see for yourself.)
