[{"type":"markdown","text":"<p>The english translation of the title (レンガ100丁) is &quot;100 bricks.&quot;</p>\n<p>This was a little simulation I made while playing around with the Godot game engine&#39;s physics.</p>\n<p>This &quot;project&quot; stems from a random urge to simulate something I saw in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xu3gsN6fmhY?t=1068\">video</a>.</p>\n<p>You have 100 bricks that are lined up like dominos. Topple one over and the rest also topple.</p>\n<p>The twist here is, after all the bricks fall over, <em>another</em> domino effect starts from the end. (It&#39;s easier if you see for yourself.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Thingy_2023/renga100chou/build/Renga%20100%20Chou.html\">Open the webapp.</a></p>\n"}]
