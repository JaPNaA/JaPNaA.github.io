Therefore, it&#39;s not very good for editing code -- perhaps just creating it.</li>\n<li>It doesn&#39;t know about the other files -- you won&#39;t be getting suggestions to use classes defined in other files.<ul>\n<li>I feel there is great potential to first let the AI &#39;understand&#39; the context, and then use the context to generate suggestions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It&#39;s very pattern-based. It&#39;ll ignore the current variable names and use variables names that seem to fit in the context.<ul>\n<li>However, it is making me more conscious of my variable names</li>\n<li>Additionally, means Github Copilot won&#39;t solve any (unique) problems you&#39;ll encounter.<ul>\n<li>If you blindly trust the code, you&#39;ll end up with bugs (or weird code)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One may not want to use Copilot because it&#39;s kind of distracting -- getting giant pieces of code suggested to you while you type.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Highlight</h3>\n<p>I was about to go to sleep because &#39;ah a collision system -- I don&#39;t want to do that at 2:00&#39;, but then I decided to try and see if it could figure out the collision detection itself.</p>\n<p>It wrote this entire thing (almost) by itself.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">\n// do collision detection //-- my comment\nfunction doCollisionDetection() {\n    for (const object of world.entities) {\n        if (object instanceof Pipe) {\n            if (bird.x + bird.width &gt; object.x &amp;&amp; bird.x &lt; object.x + object.width) {\n                if (bird.y + bird.height &gt; object.y &amp;&amp; bird.y &lt; object.y + object.gapY) {\n                    console.log(&quot;collision&quot;);\n                    bird.remove();\n                }\n                //-- I wrote &#39;if&#39;\n                if (bird.y + bird.height &gt; object.y + object.gapY + Pipe.gap &amp;&amp; bird.y &lt; object.y + object.gapY + Pipe.gap + object.height) {\n                    console.log(&quot;collision&quot;);\n                    bird.remove();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        //-- I wrote if (object instanceof Pipe)\n        if (object instanceof Rocket) {\n            if (bird.x + bird.width &gt; object.x &amp;&amp; bird.x &lt; object.x + object.width) {\n                if (bird.y + bird.height &gt; object.y &amp;&amp; bird.y &lt; object.y + object.height) {\n                    console.log(&quot;collision&quot;);\n                    bird.remove();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>AND IT WORKS.</p>\n<h3>Overall</h3>\n<p>Would I prefer using Github Copilot?</p>\n<p><em>Probably.</em> With enough &#39;practice&#39;, I should be able to understand where Github Copilot&#39;s strengths and weaknesses and maximize my productivity.</p>\n<h2>Bonus: Copilot writes my cover letter</h2>\n<p><em>I&#39;ve recently been struggling to write cover letters, so I wanted to see how copilot handles it.</em></p>\n<p>email: <a href=\"mailto:&#106;&#x6f;&#x68;&#x6e;&#46;&#100;&#x6f;&#101;&#64;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;\">&#106;&#x6f;&#x68;&#x6e;&#46;&#100;&#x6f;&#101;&#64;&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a>\nphone: +1-555-555-5555</p>\n<p>Dear John Doe,</p>\n<p>I am a software engineer at a company called <strong>Company Name</strong>.
