Been on a slight coding hiatus as I put my focus in studying Japanese, although that doesn't mean that I'm not developing at all.

Of course, almost everything that I've done is to help myself learn Japanese.

I've a modified version of [Kanji Invaders](/Thingy_2020/%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97invaders/) and [Japanese Conjugation Drill](/Thingy_2020/japaneseConjugationDrill/), and I've also some made some of my own Anki cards.

_By the way, [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) is amazing for anything that you need just need to memorize_

## This Project

Enough about life, this project was created simply because I didn't like having to open 50+ tabs of jisho.org every time I tried to read manga or watch anime. <span title="That's because my Japanese isn't very good. Despite that, I'll keep getting better every day!">だって、私の日本語があまり良くないです。それでも、毎日ずつ良くなていますよ！</span>
